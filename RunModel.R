  #ACK! this is a complicated section I don't have time to write today, but generally we'd have to make sure there were males and females, 
  #suitable habitat, and also apply some probability of mating. Then, we could also generate the number of expected offspring to give 
  #insight into how stable the population might be (if only 1 offspring, generation 3 would rely on repeated invasions, for example)
  
  #write simulation output to file - currently not written, but we'd want to output that runs parameters plus anything that 
  #is possibly interesting down the line, such as the number of mozzies left intransit and how many offspring were "created" in the new location

###NOTE: the sample function right now is binary, but to the extent possible we will substitute those better distributions. For example, probablitly
#of surviving in transit is set to 0.9, but if we know the tails of that estimate we can make the model function better.
